From the three-week study, I have learnt so much about software and programming, which enrich my knowledge, simultaneously benifiting me a lot.\r\nSince the teacher haven't teach a lot about programming, my algorithm used in comleting the given project, say, homework, mainly comes from what I learn in hello-freshmen[^hello-freshmen] as well as form the *C Primer Plus*[^c-primer-plus]. During this period, I discovered an interesting phenomenon when learning something about data types. I will place it as follow.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## A Simple Exe\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include<stdio.h>\r\n#include<stdlib.h>\r\nint main(void) {\r\n\tdouble a;\r\n\tscanf(\"%lf\", &a);\r\n\tprintf(\"double = %lf\\n\", a);\r\n\tprintf(\"int = %d\\n\", a);\r\n\tprintf(\"unsigned int = %u\\n\", a);\r\n\tsystem(\"pause\");\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\t    \r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### I/O\r\n\r\nSo simple an exe, right? Then I input -15.15, the output is like this.\r\n\r\n![](http://c.picphotos.baidu.com/album/s%3D1100%3Bq%3D90/sign=67539461a186c9170c035638f90d4bbe/21a4462309f790526abb37a70af3d7ca7acbd587.jpg)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Thoughts\r\n\r\nI input a number, -15.15, in double data type. Then I output it in different data types, such as double, int, unsigned int. The outputs, as they seems, vary. I learnt that the data types in C are not as same. If you want to learn more, You can learn it by reading *C Primer Plus* written by *Stephen Prata*.\r\nI think that a simple program contains a lot, not saying a big exe consisting of millions of code lines. Only by learning deeply as well as thinking more when writing simple exes, can I promote my skills in programming.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## P.S.\r\n\r\nThe teacher said that the blog as the homework should contain a formula. So I post a totally unrelated formula here. \r\nThe following formula is what I learnt at mathematics.\r\n$$df=f'(x)dx$$\r\nSo, thank you for watching this blog.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[^hello-freshmen]: A series of lectures aimed at teaching the zero-based students with some basic algoritms.\r\n\r\n[^c-primer-plus]:C Primer Plus (currently in the 6th Edition) is a book by Stephen Prata meant for beginners to the C programming language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
