## A Concise Self-introduction

I'm from Sun-Yat-Sen University, and I major in Software Engineering. From the three-week study, I have learnt so much about software and programming, which enrich my knowledge, simultaneously benifiting me a lot.
Since the teacher haven't teach a lot about programming, my algorithm used in comleting the given project, say, homework, mainly comes from what I learn in hello-freshmen[^hello-freshmen] as well as form the *C Primer Plus*[^c-primer-plus]. During this period, I discovered an interesting phenomenon when learning something about data types. I will place it as follow.

## A Simple Exe

### Code

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main(void) {
	double a;
	scanf("%lf", &a);
	printf("double = %lf\n", a);
	printf("int = %d\n", a);
	printf("unsigned int = %u\n", a);
	system("pause");
	return 0;
}

	    
```

### I/O

So simple an exe, right? Then I input -15.15, the output is like this.

### Thoughts

I input a number, -15.15, in double data type. Then I output it in different data types, such as double, int, unsigned int. The outputs, as they seems, vary. I learnt that the data types in C are not as same. If you want to learn more, You can learn it by reading *C Primer Plus* written by *Stephen Prata*.
I think that a simple program contains a lot, not saying a big exe consisting of millions of code lines. Only by learning deeply as well as thinking more when writing simple exes, can I promote my skills in programming.

## P.S.

The teacher said that the blog as the homework should contain a formula. So I post a totally unrelated formula here. 
The following formula is what I learnt at mathematics.
$$df=f'(x)dx$$
So, thank you for watching this blog.
